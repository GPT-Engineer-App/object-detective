# object-detective

I need to create an object detection application to identify aluminium cans, HDPE2 plastic bottles, PET1 plastic bottles, glass bottles, and milk cartons. The application will use TensorFlow Lite with EfficientDet Lite and be deployed on an Android device. The application should process live video feed from the phone's camera to detect these objects in real-time and highlight them with bounding boxes.
